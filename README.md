# DeeUnitConverter

This project is my solution to [Day 19 of 100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19).

It contains the basic functionality of temperature conversion, nothing fancy!

### Stretch goals:
- As a user, I want to be able to choose where to input temperature to be converted.
- As a user, when I select an input unit, I want this unit to be greyed out in the output picker.
- As a user, I want to be able to convert units other than temperature (such as length, time and volume).
- As a developer, I need to change the array of strings for units and use enum instead.
- As a developer, I need to refactor the computed property that returns the result to use a switch statement instead of nested if statements.
- As a developer, I would like to learn to use the [Measurement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/measurement) object.
